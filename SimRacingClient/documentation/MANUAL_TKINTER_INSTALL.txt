MANUAL TKINTER INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
==========================================

Your embedded Python 3.11.9 needs tkinter files from a matching Python version.

STEP 1: Install Python 3.11.9
------------------------------
1. Download from: https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.11.9/python-3.11.9-amd64.exe
2. Run the installer
3. Choose "Customize installation"
4. Make sure "tcl/tk and IDLE" is CHECKED
5. Note the installation path (usually C:\Program Files\Python311 or C:\Users\<your-name>\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python311)

STEP 2: Copy tkinter files
---------------------------
Copy these files FROM the Python 3.11.9 installation TO your embedded Python:

From: C:\Program Files\Python311\  (or wherever you installed it)
To: C:\Projects\Simracing\SimRacingClient\python\

Files to copy to python\ folder:
  ✓ tcl86t.dll          (from DLLs\ subfolder)
  ✓ tk86t.dll           (from DLLs\ subfolder)
  ✓ _tkinter.pyd        (from DLLs\ subfolder)
  ✓ tcl folder          (entire folder with subfolders)

Also copy to python\Lib\ folder:
  ✓ Lib\tkinter folder  (entire folder - the Python package)

STEP 3: Test
------------
Run this command to test:
  python\python.exe -c "import tkinter; print('SUCCESS')"

If it prints "SUCCESS", tkinter is installed!

STEP 4: Cleanup (optional)
---------------------------
You can uninstall the full Python 3.11.9 after copying the files.
Your embedded Python will keep working with the copied tkinter files.

TROUBLESHOOTING
---------------
If you get "ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'tkinter'":
  - Make sure ALL items above were copied (DLLs AND Lib\tkinter folder)
  - Make sure the DLL files are in python\ folder, not python\DLLs\
  - Make sure the tcl folder contains tcl8.6 subfolder
  - Make sure python\Lib\tkinter\ folder exists with __init__.py inside
  - Check python311._pth includes "Lib" on its own line (add it if missing)

If you get "DLL load failed":
  - Make sure you copied from Python 3.11.x (not 3.12, 3.13, or 3.14)
  - Make sure tcl86t.dll and tk86t.dll are in the same folder as python.exe
